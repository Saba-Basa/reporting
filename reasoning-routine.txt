STEP 0 — CLASSIFY THE QUESTION
--------------------------------
What kind of question is this?

[ ] CONDITION
    → When / under what rule does something happen?

[ ] CONTENT
    → What must one unit include or contain?

[ ] VARIABILITY
    → Why is something configurable / a parameter?

[ ] RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY
    → What must this method NOT do?


STEP 1 — APPLY THE MATCHING TEMPLATE
--------------------------------

IF CONDITION:
- Effect:
  -> What happens?
- Subject:
  -> What thing is being evaluated or acted upon?
- Reference:
  -> What is the subject compared against or constrained by?
- Relation:
  -> What relation between subject and reference triggers the effect?
- Normalized sentence:
  -> Under what exact condition should the effect occur?


IF CONTENT:
- Unit:
  -> What is the smallest repeatable thing produced?
- Purpose:
  -> What is the single function of this thing?
- Required information:
  -> What facts must be known for this thing to fulfill that function?
- Explicit exclusions:
  -> What is explicitly NOT required?


IF VARIABILITY:
- What can change:
  -> What value or rule differs between contexts or executions?
- Who decides this value:
  -> Who should control that change (caller or callee)?
- Why it cannot be hard-coded:
  -> Why must this not be fixed inside the method?


IF RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY:
- Core responsibility:
  -> What is this method/class responsible for producing or deciding?
- Adjacent concerns:
  -> What related concerns exist nearby but are separate?
- Explicit exclusions:
  -> What must be excluded to keep the responsibility pure?


STEP 2 — FINAL CHECK
--------------------
- Am I stating guarantees only?
- Am I avoiding speculation?
- Is the answer constrained to the code / problem given?
