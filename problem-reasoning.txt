SOFTWARE PROBLEM REASONING TEMPLATE

1. Purpose
- Why does this component exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- What responsibility does it have?

2. Input → Output
- What is the input?
- What is the output?
- What transformation happens in between?
- raw data → derived / structured information

3. Data Modeling
- Why this data structure?
- Why not a simpler or different one?
- What does one unit of output represent conceptually?

4. Assumptions & Boundaries
- What may this code assume?
- What must it derive from input?
- What must it NOT invent, validate, or decide?

5. Edge Cases
- Empty input
- Unknown or unexpected values
- Absence vs error
- Zero / null / negative values

6. Responsibility Check
- Does this component store state or only operate on data?
- Why does this logic belong here and not elsewhere?
- What would be wrong to put here?

ANCHOR QUESTION
"What is the input, 
what is the output, 
and what responsibility lies in between?"
