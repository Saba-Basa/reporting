Step 1 — Identify the effect
What happens? (What is produced, triggered, decided?)

Step 2 — Identify the subject
What thing is being evaluated or acted upon?

Step 3 — Identify the reference
What is the subject compared against or constrained by?

Step 4 — Identify the axis of change
What relation, comparison, or event causes the effect?

Step 5 — Apply the condition form
“Under what exact condition between <subject> and <reference>
should <effect> occur?”

Step 6 — Answer in one normalized sentence
State the condition from the subject’s perspective,
using canonical verbs (exceeds, equals, is less than).
