Step 1 — Responsibility:
What is the method responsible for producing or deciding?

Step 2 — Unit of output:
What is the smallest meaningful piece of output?

Step 3 — Cardinality:
How many such units can exist (zero / one / many)?

Step 4 — Representation:
How should one unit be represented (text, number, structure)?

Step 5 — Shape:
How should multiple units be returned or handled?

Step 6 — Exclusions:
What does this method explicitly not do?
